## Pre
This is some notes and record when I am learning the book *A Probability Path* by Resnick, After finishing chapter 1~3, I thought I should record it, for the record, here is the protocol about how I do exercises:

  * I try to write down anything that I could, even if knowing that something is going wrong
  * Compare to the answer, figure out what's going wrong
  * Close the answer and do it again, untill I can do I **completely** on my own

And I'll record the first idea and the right answer here.

## Chap 1

## Chap 2

## Chap 3

## Chap 4, Independence

### Summary
Firstly, we defined the definition of independence (of 2 events)

Then:

* The independence of finite events
* The independence of finite classes (collection of events)
* The independence of arbitrary number of classes, by focusing of all the finite subset
* Further, if the independent classes are $\pi$-system, then the $\sigma$-field then generated are also independent

Then we go to the measurable function part, and for a R.V X, we focus on the $\sigma$-field it generates, $\sigma(X)$.

Secondly, we have grouping on a collection of independent $\sigma$-field

* If we divide an index set into mutually disjoint subsets, then the $\sigma$-fields generated associated to these subset index are independent.

Thirdly, we have the 0-1 laws.

* Borel: for independent events $\{A_n\}$,if we want to study its limsup, $[A_n\; i.o]$, we can try study $\sum_{n}P(A_n)$
* Kolmogorov: for independent R.Vs $\{X_n\}$, the information from infinity is almost trivial, and independent to the information of all the $\{X_n\}$.
